This script performs web scraping of literary works by Cesar Aira from the Wikipedia page using Python libraries such as requests and BeautifulSoup. The script fetches the HTML content of the Wikipedia page and extracts text containing the titles of novels and their release years. The extracted data is then written into a CSV file named 'obras_y_a√±os.csv' using the DictWriter from the csv module. Then we clean and organize the data from the dataset through PowerQuery, and then through PowerBi we make a simple visualization of the percentages of novels per year, throughout Cesar Aira's literary work.
